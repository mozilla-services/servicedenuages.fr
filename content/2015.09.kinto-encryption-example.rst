A guest post this time, by `Michiel de Jong <https://michielbdejong.com/>`_

If you want to encrypt data that is uploaded to the cloud by an offline-first app,
it makes sense to keep the local copy of the data in-the-clear, and encrypt the
data only just before it is uploaded. That way, you can easily and efficiently display
and update the local copy of the data, without the repeated cost of encrypting
and decrypting everything all the time. Likewise, you only need to decrypt incoming data
once, when it's downloaded, and your app can then display the data as often as
needed without extra processing costs.

Syncing data to and from "the cloud" is a science in itself, and
`Kinto.js <https://github.com/Kinto/kinto.js>`_ is a brilliant tool for this, developed
by the equally brilliant Mozilla Services team. It's nearing its 1.0 release, and you'll
hear a lot more about it on this blog in the future.

It so happens that Kinto.js now supports
`RemoteTransformers <http://kintojs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/#transformers>`_,
which are superhandy for any type of transformation you may want to do on your data
before it is saved into the locally cached copy (``RemoteTransformer#decode``), and before it is uploaded to the
remote server (``RemoteTransformer#encode``).

This blogpost shows how to use a ``RemoteTransformer`` for encrypting your data just
before it's sent to the cloud. It uses WebCrypto for the cryptography.

Note that I am not a security expert and this is just an example I wrote in an afternoon, so
if you're going to copy-paste this code, please don't use it for anything
valuable without doing your own proper security review first! :) For instance, it does
not do any key stretching etcetera, it's just a very basic encrypt/decrypt
proof-of-concept.

The main idea behind a ``RemoteTransformer`` is that you provide two functions,
``encode`` and ``decode``, and Kinto.js makes sure to call the encode function on
each record that gets uploaded, and to call the decode function on each record
that gets downloaded. You can also read about this
`in the Kinto.js documentation <http://kintojs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/#transformers>`_.

The way we tell Kinto.js that we want to use our custom
``encode`` and ``decode`` procedures, is quite simple. When creating a Kinto
collection, we pass a ``RemoteTransformer`` as a collection-level option. The full
code example is
`here </scripts/kinto-encryption-example.js>`_ (note that it only works with
`latest Kinto.js master </scripts/kinto-61ad959.min.js>`_),
but let's walk through the code step-by-step.

If you're unfamiliar with ES6, you may be surprised by some of this syntax; so let's
take this opportunity to get used to it! Here's a little translation:

- `() => {} <http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/#arrows-and-lexical-this>`_ is similar to ``(function() {}).bind(this)``.
- `const foo = 'bar'; let foo = 'bar'; <http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/#let-const>`_ are similar to ``var foo = 'bar'``.
- `{ a, b } <http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/#enhanced-object-literals>`_ is similar to ``{ a: a, b: b }``.
- `\`Hello ${foo}\` <http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/#template-strings>`_ (note the backticks) is similar to ``'Hello ' + foo``.

First, we need a few helper functions, which will be used later on to convert between
`byte arrays <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays>`_
and ASCII strings.

.. code-block:: JavaScript

    // Helper functions:
    const rawStringToByteArray = (str) => {
      const strLen = str.length;
      var byteArray = new Uint8Array(strLen);
      for (var i = 0; i < strLen; i++) {
        byteArray[i] = str.charCodeAt(i);
      }
      return byteArray;
    };
    const base64StringToByteArray = (base64) => {
      return rawStringToByteArray(window.atob(base64));
    };
    const byteArrayToBase64String = (buffer) => {
      var bytes = new Uint8Array(buffer);
      var binary = '';
      for (var i=0; i<bytes.byteLength; i++) {
          binary += String.fromCharCode(bytes[i]);
      }
      return window.btoa(binary);
    };

Next, we need to create a ``RemoteTransformer`` that can encode and decode records. And for
that, we need to generate an
`AES <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard>`_ key.
`WebCrypto <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto>`_ is a
fairly new part of `the web platform <https://platform.html5.org/>`_ and it's awesome.
We will use that key to encrypt and decrypt
the data that is passed through the ``RemoteTransformer``:

.. code-block:: JavaScript

    // RemoteTransformer:
    const generateAesKey = () => {
      // See http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#examples-symmetric-encryption
      return window.crypto.subtle.generateKey({ name: 'AES-GCM', length: 128 },
           false, ['encrypt', 'decrypt']);
    };

    const createTransformer = (aesKey) => {
      const encode = (record) => {
        const cleartext = rawStringToByteArray(JSON.stringify(record));
        const IV = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(16));

        return window.crypto.subtle.encrypt({ name: 'AES-GCM', iv: IV }, aesKey,
            cleartext).then(ciphertext => {
          return {
            id: record.id,
            ciphertext: byteArrayToBase64String(new Uint8Array(ciphertext)),
            IV: byteArrayToBase64String(IV)
          };
        });
      };

      const decode = (record) => {
        const ciphertext = base64StringToByteArray(record.ciphertext);
        const IV = base64StringToByteArray(record.IV);

        return crypto.subtle.decrypt({ name: 'AES-GCM', iv: IV }, aesKey,
            ciphertext).then(recordArrayBuffer => {

          return JSON.parse(String.fromCharCode.apply(null,
              new Uint8Array(recordArrayBuffer)));
        }, () => {
          record.undecryptable = true;
          return record;
        });
      };

      return {
        encode,
        decode
      };
    };

We create two Kinto instances, so that we can test syncing from one instance
to the other, via the public Kinto demo instance on AWS. Creating multiple Kinto
instances within the same origin is now possible with the recently added
``dbPrefix`` option:

.. code-block:: JavaScript

    // Kinto collection:
    const createCollection = (transformer, testRun, instanceNo) => {
      const kinto = new Kinto({
        dbPrefix: `${testRun}-${instanceNo}`,
        remote: 'https://kinto.dev.mozaws.net/v1/',
        headers: {
          Authorization: 'Basic ' + btoa('public-demo:s3cr3t')
        }
      });

      return kinto.collection(`kinto-encryption-example-${testRun}`, {
        remoteTransformers: [ transformer ]
      });
    };

    var coll1, coll2;
    const prepare = () => {
      return generateAesKey().then(aesKey => {
        return createTransformer(aesKey);
      }).then(transformer => {
        // Create two fresh empty Kinto instances for testing:
        const testRun = new Date().getTime().toString();
        coll1 = createCollection(transformer, testRun, 1);
        coll2 = createCollection(transformer, testRun, 2);
      });
    };

Now, let's test if we can create an item in collection 1, sync it up (the data
should be encrypted on the wire, we can check that on the Network tab of the
browser console):

.. image:: {filename}/images/kinto-encryption-example-network-tab.png
   :alt: Network tab screenshot

.. code-block:: JavaScript

    const syncUp = () => {
      // Use first Kinto instance to demonstrate encryption:
      return coll1.create({
        URL: 'http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/',
        name: 'Web Cryptography API'
      }).then(() => {
        return coll1.sync();
      }).then(syncResults => {
        console.log('Sync up', syncResults);
      });
    };

And sync it down from the cloud again using collection 2. Again, the data
coming in on the wire should be encrypted, but the decrypted results should
show up in the sync results. And finally, a 'go()' method to put it all together.

The full source code is included in a script tag on this page you're reading right
now, so go ahead and try opening your browser console on this page to try it out!

.. code-block:: JavaScript

    const syncDown = () => {
      // Use second Kinto instance to demonstrate decryption:
      return coll2.sync().then(syncResults => {
        console.log('Sync down', syncResults);
      });
    };

    const go = () => {
      console.log('Watch the Network tab!');
      return prepare().then(() => {
        return syncUp();
      }).then(() => {
        return syncDown();
      }).then(a => console.log('Success', a), b => console.error('Failure', b));
    };
    console.log('Type go(); to start!');

Hope you are as excited about Kinto.js as I am, comments below this blogpost
and github issues on the example code very welcome! :)
