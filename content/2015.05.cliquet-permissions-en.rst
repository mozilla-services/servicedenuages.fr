:summary: Where we clarify the vocabulary around permissions and explain what
          we plan to implement for our generic data storage solution, Kinto.
:slug: la-gestion-des-permissions
:lang: en

When creating a generic data storage (Kinto), permissions handling is one of
the big challenges: who should get access to what, and how should we define
these rules?

**tl;dr: Some feedback about the permissions vocabulary and our ideas about how
to implement permissions management in a generic data storage system**

The problem at hand
===================

The problem we're facing is simple: data is stored online and we need a way to
share this data with other people.

Looking at the use cases, it's possible to split our users in two categories:

- End users (you);
- Applications which interact on their behalf.

Different parties don't have the same rights: some should be able to read,
others should write, yet another should be able to create new records, and all
this permission handling should be fine-grained: it should be possible to read
one record but not the other, for instance.

We started from the fact that no available solution was offering an appealing
solution to these needs.


A vocabulary problem
====================

The principal problem that got in our way during our thinking was the
vocabulary.


Principals
----------

A *principal*, is an entity that can be authenticated by a computer system.
It is the actor who does the action. [#]_

It could either be someone, a computer, a service or a group of any of such
things. This is conceptually wider than the classical "user id*".

Permissions are then associated to these *principals*.

For instance, a user is identified in an unique way when he connects to the
authentication system, which role is to define a list of *principals* for the
authenticating user.

The difference between a role and a group
-----------------------------------------

From scratch, it's not easy to precisely define the difference between these two
concepts which allow to associate permissions to a group of *principals*. [#]_

The difference is mainly semantic, but we can see a difference in the "direction"
of the relationship between these two concepts.

- A role is a list of permissions associated to a *principal*;
- A group is a list of *principals* we can associate to a permission.

The difference between permission, ACL and ACE
----------------------------------------------

.. epigraph::

  An ACL is a list of Access Control Entry (ACE) enabling or disabling
  acces rights to a person or a group.

  -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_Control_List

I would even say, in our case, "to a *principal*". For instance:

.. code-block:: text

    create_record: alexis,remy,tarek

This ACE gives the ``create`` permission on the ``record`` object to the users
Tarek, Rémy and Alexis.


Permissions delegation
======================

Imagine the following example, where Alice stores two types of data online:

- a list of contacts ;
- a list of tasks, which can be associated to her contacts.

Alice has all the rights on its data.

However, she's using two applications which should have a restricted access:

- One application to handle contacts, to which she wants to delegate the entire
  management: ``contacts:write`` ;
- Another application to handle the tasks, to which she wants to delegate the
  management of the tasks, and the reading of the contacts: ``contacts:read
  tasks:write``

She wants to prevent her contacts application to access the tasks and the tasks
app should not be able to update existing contacts, just eventually creating
new ones.

She then needs a way to delegate some of her permissions to a third party (the
app).

That's precisely the role of `OAuth2 scopes
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#page-23>`_.

During the connection of a user, a window will ask her which access she wants
to give to the application that will act on her behalf.

The service will then have access to these *scopes* by looking at the
used authentication token. This information should be considered as a user
input (that is, we cannot trust it). It is what the user *wants*, not what the
user *should have access to*.

It's possible that the user don't have access to the requested data. The
service should use two levels of permissions: the user ones, and the ones that
were delegated to the application.


Namespaces
==========

In our initial implementation of *Kinto* (our generic data storage service),
the *namespace* was implicit: stored data was necessarily tied to the connected
user.

User data were then impossible to share.

*Namespaces* are a simple way to handle the data sharing problem.

We chose to re-use the GitHub and BitBucket mode, which uses "organisations" as
*namespaces*.

In our case, it's possible to create "buckets", which are one of these
*namespaces*. A bucket is a container for collections and user groups.

ACLs on these collections can be given to certain groups of the bucket, and
directly to other *principals*.


Our API proposal
================

Manipulated objects
-------------------

To handle permissions, we identified the following objects:

+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Object          | Description                                             |
+=================+=========================================================+
| **bucket**      | We can see them as *namespaces*. They allow to have     |
|                 | different collections having the same name but stored   |
|                 | in different *buckets* so that data are distinct.       |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| **collection**  | A list of records.                                      |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| **record**      | A record from a collection                              |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| **group**       | A group of principals                                   |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

To define ACLs, there is a hierarchy: objects inherit the ACLs from their
parents.

        |                           |
        |                           |

    | Record         |
    +----------------+

    |  - data        |
    |  - permissions |
    +----------------+


Permissions
-----------

For all of these objects, we identified the following permissions:

+------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Permission | Description                             |
+============+=========================================+
| **read**   | The permission to read the content of   |
|            | the object and all its children.        |
+------------+-----------------------------------------+
| **write**  | The permission to modify and            |
|            | administration an object and all its    |
|            | children objects. The *write*           |
|            | permission allows reading, modification |
|            | and deletion of objects, and the        |
|            | handling of permissions on this object. |
+------------+-----------------------------------------+
| **create** | The permission to create the specified  |
|            | child object. For instance:             |
|            | ``collections:create``                  |
+------------+-----------------------------------------+

To each specified permission on an object is associated a list of *principals*.

For the ``create`` permission, we are forced to specify which child the
permission applies to since an object can have different kind of child nodes.
For instance: ``collections:create``, ``groups:create``.

We don't have a `delete` and `update` permission so far, because we don't have
any use case which needs them. Whoever with the ``write`` permission can also
delete a record.

Permissions from an object are inherited from its parent. For instance,
a record created in a collection available to anyone will also be available to
anyone.

Said differently, it's not possible that an object has a more restrictive
permission that its parent.

Here is a complete list of permissions:

+----------------+------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Object         | Associated permissions | Comment                           |
+================+========================+===================================+
| Configuration  | `buckets:create`       | *Principals* who can create       |
| (.ini)         |                        | a bucket are defined in the       |
|                |                        | service configuration (for        |
|                |                        | instance "authenticated users")   |
+----------------+------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| ``bucket``     | `write`                | The "admin" permission for the    |
|                |                        | *bucket*.                         |
|                +------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                | `read`                 | The permission to read all the    |
|                |                        | content of all objects in the     |
|                |                        | *bucket*.                         |

|                +------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                | `groups:create`        | Permission to create groups       |
|                |                        | in the *bucket*.                  |
+----------------+------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| ``collection`` | `write`                | Permission to administrate all    |
|                |                        | objects in the collection.        |
|                +------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                | `read`                 | Permission to consult all         |
|                |                        | objects in the collection.        |
|                +------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                | `records:create`       | Permission to create new          |
|                |                        | records in the collection.        |
+----------------+------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| ``record``     | `write`                | Permission to modify or share     |
|                |                        | the record.                       |
|                +------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                | `read`                 | Permission to read the record.    |
|                |                        |                                   |
+----------------+------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| ``group``      | `write`                | Permission to administrate the    |
|                |                        | group.                            |
|                +------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                | `read`                 | Permission to know the members of |
|                |                        | the group.                        |
+----------------+------------------------+-----------------------------------+


*principals*
------------

Actors connecting to the storage service can authenticate themselves.

They then receive a list of *principals*:

- ``Everyone``: the *principal* given to all actors (authenticated or not);
- ``Authenticated``: the *principal* given to all authenticated actors;
- A *principal* identifying the actor, for instance ``fxa:32aa95a474c984d41d395e2d0b614aa2``

In order to avoid identifiers collisions, the actor *principal* is built from
the authentication type used (``system``, ``basic``, ``ipaddr``, ``hawk``,
``fxa``) and the identifier.

Depending the *bucket* on which the action is taking place, the groups the user
is a member of are also added to her list of principals (e.g.
``group:moderators``)

So, if Bob connects with his *Firefox Account* on the ``servicedenuages_blog``
bucket, on which he is a member of the ``moderators`` group, he would have the
following list of principals:
``Everyone, Authenticated, fxa:32aa95a474c984d41d395e2d0b614aa2, group:moderators``

It's then possible to assign a permission to Bob by using one of these
*principals*.

.. note::

    The ``<userid>`` **principal** depends on the authentication *back-end* used (e.g.
    ``github:leplatrem``).

+-------------------------+-----------------------+--------------------------+

**Platforms**

Of course, there are many ways to modelize common use cases. For instance, it's
possible to imagine a wiki platform (ala wikia.com) where wikis are private by
default and some pages can be published:


+-------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------+
| Object                  | Permissions           | Principals                  |
+=========================+=======================+=============================+
| ``bucket:freewiki``     | ``write``             |``fxa:<administrator id>``   |
|                         +-----------------------+-----------------------------+
|                         | ``collection:create`` | ``Authenticated``           |
|                         +-----------------------+-----------------------------+
|                         | ``group:create``      | ``Authenticated``           |
+-------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------+
| ``collection:<wiki id>``| ``write``             | ``fxa:<wiki owner id>``,    |
|                         |                       | ``group:<editors id>``      |
|                         +-----------------------+-----------------------------+
|                         | ``read``              | ``group:<readers id>``      |
+-------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------+
| ``record:<page id>``    | ``read``              | ``Everyone``                |
+-------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------+


The HTTP API
------------

During the creation of an object, the user is given the ``write`` permission on
the object:

.. code-block:: http

    PUT /v1/buckets/servicedenuages_blog HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer 0b9c2625dc21ef05f6ad4ddf47c5f203837aa32ca42fced54c2625dc21efac32
    Accept: application/json

    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
        "id": "servicedenuages_blog",
        "permissions": {
            "write": ["fxa:49d02d55ad10973b7b9d0dc9eba7fdf0"]
        }
    }

It's possible to add permissions using the ``PATCH`` HTTP method.

.. code-block:: http

    PATCH /v1/buckets/servicedenuages_blog/collections/articles HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer 0b9c2625dc21ef05f6ad4ddf47c5f203837aa32ca42fced54c2625dc21efac32
    Accept: application/json

    {
        "permissions": {
            "read": ["+system.Everyone"]
        }
    }

    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
        "id": "servicedenuages_blog",
        "permissions": {
            "write": ["fxa:49d02d55ad10973b7b9d0dc9eba7fdf0"],
            "read": ["system.Everyone"]
        }
    }

For ``PATCH``, we are thinking about using a syntax prefixed with a ``+`` or
a ``-`` to add or remove *principals* on an ACL.

It is also possible to do a ``PUT`` to reset the ACLs, knowing that the ``PUT``
will then add the current user to the list. It's possible to use a ``PATCH`` to
remove herself from the list. Adding the current user allows to avoid
situations where nobody has access to the data anymore.

.. note:: 

    The ``create`` permission is used for a ``POST`` but also for a ``PUT``
    when the record doesn't exist.


The specific case of user data
------------------------------

One of the current feature of *Kinto* is to handle record collections by user.

On *\*nix* systems, it's possible, for an application, to save configuration
for the current user in her personal folder, without bothering about its
specific location, using ``~``.

In our case, if an application want to save contacts for a user, it can use
a shortcut to reference the *personal* bucket of the user:
``/buckets/personal/collections/contacts``.

This URL will return a ``HTTP 307`` to the current user *bucket*.

.. code-block:: http

    POST /v1/buckets/personal/collections/contacts/records HTTP/1.1

Like so, it's possible for Alice to share her contacts with Bob. She just have
to give the ``read`` permission to Bob on her collection and give him the
complete URL:
``/v1/buckets/fxa:49d02d55ad10973b7b9d0dc9eba7fdf0/collections/contacts/records``.

Permissions delegation
----------------------

In *Kinto*, we defined a format to restrict permissions using OAuth2 scopes:
``storage:<bucket_id>:<collection_id>:<permissions_list>``.

Taking back the previous *tasks* example, it is possible for Bob to create
a specific OAuth2 token with the following *scopes*:
``profile storage:todolist:tasks:write storage:personal:contacts:read+records:create``

Like so, even if Bob has the ``write`` permission on his contacts, the
application using this token will only be able to read the existing contacts
and add new ones.

One part of the complexity is to manage presenting these *scopes* in a readable
way to the user, so she or he is able to chose which permissions to give to the
applications acting on her behalf.

So, here is where we're at with our thinking!

If you have things to add or discuss with this proposal, don't hesitate to
interrupt us while it's still possible!
