:summary: A/B testing is a form of statistical hypothesis testing. Its
          goal is to identify changes to web pages that increase or
          maximize an outcome of interest. Let's see how we can use
          Kinto to use this technique on our website.

Background
==========

The Fennec team, building Firefox for Android, is using
`Switchboard from KeepSafe`_, which is an open source project that
targets Mobile app feature switching and A/B testing.

For the Fennec team, the update of experiments data is a bit
cumbersome, the data is stored on a github repository and the
switchboard server needs to be updated and reloaded with newer data on
every change.

They eventually saw the `kinto-admin`_ for another project and,
because the swichboard logic can be done on client-side, they decided
to try to switch `from Switchboard to Kinto`_ to handle the experiments
data.

It is `a work in progress`_ in the Fennec code base but we have
decided to explore how we could use a similar approach to use Kinto to
A/B test the web.

Introduction
============

I am not a big fan of A/B testing because I think, most of the time,
`we can do better`_ however in `certain circumstances`_ A/B testing is
still a really good idea to test a feature.

In an other hand, I am a big fan of the philosophy behind Kinto_ which
as you may know is a database for the web.

In this article, I will take you through a little experiment I did
lately to extend the `work that has been done`_ to activate a feature
for some users in Firefox for Android.

How does A/B testing works?
===========================

You just created a really nice feature and you want to test multiple
UX solutions in order to decide which one is most usable for your users.

For instance, what is the best wording for the French banner?

You can use A/B testing to test different variations on your user
base and select the best option.

There are two technical parts on this:

1. You need to display a different version of your banner to your users,
   probably with the same code.
2. You need to be able to get the conversion rate for each solution to
   be able to compare them.


A word about the repartition algorithm
======================================

The reason why we can use Kinto for this, is that we can run the
bucket repartition algorithm on client side.

Because it is easier to think in terms of percentages, we chose to
split users in 100 buckets with a bucket ID from 0 to 99.

We then need a way to get a bucket ID for our user device with a
homogeneous distribution on the bucket space.

One way to do that is to generate a random UUID and to store it on the
device. But storing that value can be a bit cumbersome.

To make this user bucket stateless, on mobile we can use the device ID
and on the web we can use the `fingerprint.js`_ project that aims to
generate a unique user id from the browser configuration.

We can then use the modulo function to calculate the user bucket ID
from this device ID.

.. code-block:: javascript

    const fingerprint = {deviceID: "1433179b5711413ba3c404075a629376"};
    const deviceID = parseInt(fingerprint.deviceID, 16);
    const userBucket = deviceID % 100;
    // userBucket = 68


With `fingerprint.js`_ specifically, it looks like that:

.. code-block:: javascript

    new Fingerprint2().get(function(deviceIDString) {

      // Convert the device ID hex string into an integer
      const deviceID = parseInt(deviceIDString, 16);

      // Use a modulo on the device ID value to calculate the user bucket
      const userBucket = deviceID % 100;

    });


How to use Kinto to know in which test your user is?
====================================================

Apart from being a web service whose API is based on the simple and
universal JSON format, one of the benefits of using Kinto_ is that you
will be able to use the `kinto-admin`_ to configure your experiments.

.. image:: {filename}/images/kinto-admin-screenshot.png
    :alt: Adding an experiment with the kinto-admin.

An experiment has got a ``name`` and a ``description`` as well as some
``match`` rules and a ``buckets`` range.

For the web, in my proof of concept, matching rules can be defined as
regexp on the user languages, country or user-agent.

While defining an experiment we can decide to include a range of
buckets using the ``min`` and ``max`` buckets attributes.

An experiment is then stored in Kinto like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name": "french-banner",
        "description": "Try the new French banner",
        "match": {
            "country": "FR",
            "lang": "fr"
        },
        "buckets": {
            "min": "0",
            "max": "50"
        },
        "values": {
            "url": "https://firefoxos.mozfr.org/dotclear/public/Firefox_OS/.Gerez_votre_vie_privee_intelligemment_Mozilla_m.png"
        }
    }


From this experiment description we can extract two crutial pieces of
information that we need to track:

- **user matches**: Is the user matching the experiment?
- **user in buckets**: Is the user in one of the targeted buckets?

These two information will be used for the metrics part to decide if we
should use the new solution rather than the previous one.

If you are currently in France, you can `try this experiment`_.

The good news is that you will be able to change the experiment
settings after the release using the `kinto-admin`_.

If you want to start with the feature off for everyone, you can just
set the same buckets configuration value for both ``min`` and ``max``
and it will turn it off.

How to use Kinto to store the experiment metrics?
=================================================

First with regards to the experiment you want to do, you need a way to
trigger metrics.

In the case of the previous example, the metric could be to monitor
the number of clicks on the banner when it is written in French or when
it is written in English for people in France.

Using the power of Kinto permissions, we can create a collection where
people will be able to create new records in it but not change them.

Using HTTPie_ we can do it like that:

.. code-block:: bash

    http PUT https://demo.kinto-storage.org/v1/buckets/switchboard --auth admin:switchboard

    echo '{"permissions": {"record:create": ["system.Everyone"]}}' | \
        http PUT https://demo.kinto-storage.org/v1/buckets/switchboard/collections/metrics \
            --auth admin:switchboard

.. _HTTPie: https://httpie.org

Then when people match, we record our metrics:

.. code-block:: javascript

    fetch("https://demo.kinto-storage.org/v1/buckets/switchboard/collections/metrics/records", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({data: {
        name: "french-banner",
        matches: true,
        inBucket: false
      }})
    });


You can then count the number of calls with or without the banner:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ http HEAD 'https://demo.kinto-storage.org/v1/buckets/switchboard/collections/metrics/records?matches=true&inBucket=true' \
        --auth admin:switchboard | grep Total-Records:
    Total-Records: 300

    $ http HEAD 'https://demo.kinto-storage.org/v1/buckets/switchboard/collections/metrics/records?matches=true&inBucket=false' \
        --auth admin:switchboard --print=h | grep Total-Records:
    Total-Records: 20


Conclusion
==========

Because we can calculate the user bucket on client side, we do not
have to actually run the bucket repartition algorithm on the server side.

We could even use Kinto to store the number of time the banner have
been displayed to make sure of the bucket repartition.

The `kinto-admin`_ makes it really easy to handle experiment
configuration variables.
