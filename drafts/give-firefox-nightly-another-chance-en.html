<h2>What is Nightly?</h2>
<p>The Firefox Nightly build also known as Firefox Nightly is a version
of Firefox built from the source code every day at night.</p>
<p>This means that Firefox updates itself every day!</p>
<img alt="You've just been upgraded to Firefox Nightly 54!" class="align-center" src="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/images/nightly.png" style="width: 1283px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;width: 1283px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-aren-t-you-using-nightly-today">
<h2>Why aren't you using Nightly today?</h2>
<p>Everyone wants a stable Firefox and you don't have time for a crappy
browser experience.</p>
<p>Although it wasn't always the case, Firefox Nightly is now more
stable than ever. The number of crashes has been reduced and it
is getting much further every day.</p>
<p>Additionally most of the bugs that you might have will be fixed the
next day.</p>
<p>You can always go in the <cite>Help &gt; About Firefox</cite> menu to make sure you
have the last update!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-you-should-actually-give-firefox-nightly-a-try">
<h2>Why you should actually give Firefox Nightly a try</h2>
<p>By installing Firefox Nightly you will:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Have new Mozilla Firefox features 18 weeks earlier</li>
<li>Have a much faster Firefox</li>
<li>Make a difference</li>
<li>Help reduce the number of crashes for Mozilla Firefox users</li>
<li>Make sure Mozilla Firefox source code is in a workable state</li>
<li>Help add-on developers to validate that their add-ons are still working</li>
<li>Have a better developer experience to develop your apps</li>
<li>Make a really valuable contribution to the Mozilla project without coding</li>
<li>Participate at building a Free, Libre, and Open Source browser that respects user privacy</li>
<li>Have a real impact on how the Web is built nowadays.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="have-a-much-faster-firefox">
<h3>Have a much faster Firefox</h3>
<p>Firefox is getting smaller!</p>
<p>New features are now tested through add-ons using
<a class="reference external" href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/">Test Pilot</a> instead of getting
added to Firefox. This means less bugs and only great features by
default.</p>
<p>Firefox is getting faster!</p>
<p>This year 2017, Firefox is going to ship the <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum">Quantum</a> project which is a
next-generation Web engine. It benefits from some critical parts of
Gecko being rewritten in Rust which makes them 10 to 100 times faster
than before by using parallelization and GPU offloading.</p>
<p>This is happening now and you will get it 3 months early.</p>
<p>Not only that, Quantum is a lot more secure, the rewrite is a good
opportunity to have a brand new and better-tested code base which
means that you are less likely to have bugs in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="have-new-mozilla-firefox-features-18-weeks-before">
<h3>Have new Mozilla Firefox features 18 weeks before</h3>
<p>Mozilla Firefox is on a fixed Release Calendar workflow called trains,
which means that developer can plan their features to land in a
certain version and coordinate other teams work (QA, OPS, Service
developers, Deployments, Translations) for a certain date.</p>
<p>In case the deadline is missed, they will have to wait for the next
release 6 weeks later.</p>
<p>Today, there are 4 versions of Firefox:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Firefox Nightly, which is a tag of Mozilla Central every day</li>
<li>Firefox Developer Edition, which is a tag of Nightly every 6 weeks</li>
<li>Firefox Beta, which is a release of the previous Developer edition branch</li>
<li>Firefox Release, which is a release of the previous Beta branch</li>
</ul>
<p>With Nightly, the release is everyday, which means you will be the
first one to benefit from new features, while other people will
have to wait more than 3 months before being able to use them (less
than 6 weeks in Nightly, 6 weeks for Developer Edition, 6 weeks for
Beta).</p>
<p>Not only that, but some features are only activated in Nightly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="make-a-difference-and-help-reduce-the-number-of-crashes-for-mozilla-firefox-users">
<h3>Make a difference and help reduce the number of crashes for Mozilla Firefox users</h3>
<p>The more users we have in Nightly, the more stable future versions of
Firefox become.</p>
<p>If everybody waits to use the last release of Firefox, it means
that Developer Edition and Beta steps don't make any sense because
they will not be used and bugs that might occur will appear directly
at the Release stage, making a poor Firefox experience for people that
don't even know what a browser is.</p>
<p>By using Nightly, you will help us make a really great Firefox and as
a benefit you will have this great Firefox experience 3 months ahead
of schedule!</p>
<p>Also most of the time, if you discover a problem with your Firefox
Nightly, it will be fixed in the next release the day after, while
with Firefox Release you will potentially have to wait for 6 weeks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="help-add-on-developers-to-validate-that-their-add-ons-are-still-working">
<h3>Help add-on developers to validate that their add-ons are still working</h3>
<img alt="Add-ons for Firefox" class="align-center" src="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/images/amo.png" style="width: 1283px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;width: 1283px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>
<p>Firefox is transitioning from a complex and error-prone way of
writing add-ons to a standardized way of writing Web extensions, which
are most likely to be compatible with Chrome and use well known Web
technologies which makes them easier to develop.</p>
<p>This is challenging for add-ons creators that already have a working
add-on that needs to be rewritten.</p>
<p>As a community we can help them. If they already have a Google Chrome
add-on, it is most likely that they will be able to install it in
Firefox directly. Plus, Firefox plans to expose more add-ons API
than Chrome and we will create more in 2017 to help as much as
possible port previous add-ons to the Web extensions standard.</p>
<p>As an early adopter we can help to test these new add-ons to keep a
good experience for our users.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="have-a-better-developer-experience-to-develop-your-web-apps">
<h3>Have a better developer experience to develop your Web apps</h3>
<p>If you develop Web applications you might have had some problems to
debug them with Firefox.</p>
<p>We have a full team of developers dedicated to make Firefox the best
tool for developping Web applications. This team is improving Web
developer tools everyday and by using Nightly it will make your life
easier.</p>
<p>I hope that at some point you will even want to open Firefox because
it is easiser than debugging your app in Chrome. And I have good hope
that we reach this point in 2017.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="give-a-really-valuable-contribution-to-the-mozilla-project-without-coding">
<h3>Give a really valuable contribution to the Mozilla project without coding</h3>
<p>Often people ask me how they can contribute to the Mozilla Firefox
project.</p>
<p>To be honest, starting to use Nightly today is a real huge step toward
that goal.</p>
<p>To use Firefox Nightly as a daily user is a simple and awesome way to
help Firefox because it gives us feedback on the work we are doing
ahead of time and also immediately. We don't have to wait for 18 weeks to
get feedback on our work, we can have it the day after.</p>
<p>As of this writing, we have only few handfuls of users for Firefox
Nightly so your choice to use it makes a huge difference to us.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I hope you are now convinced that you can help us to make a better
Firefox by starting to use Firefox Nightly today.</p>
<p>You can install the <a class="reference external" href="https://nightly.mozilla.org/">desktop Firefox version</a> as well as your
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/android/">Android Firefox version</a></p>
<p>Once you are using Firefox Nightly, <strong>if you see something, say something</strong>.</p>
<p>You will have a good chance to see it fixed the day after, while if
you don't say anything it might never get fixed...</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">File a Bug in our bugtracker</a> (you
can now login with your Github account).</p>
<p>However in case of crashes, the bug report is sent automatically for
you with the detail that will hopefully help developpers to reproduce
it, so you don't need to do anything.</p>
