<p>Today, I realized that I've been working for Mozilla for three years
already.</p>
<p>I've learned a lot, and with the storage team we have been part of a
number of different projects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Firefox Hello: Building a WebRTC signaling service.</li>
<li>MSISDN auth: Building a password less BrowserID authentication
service using a phone number.</li>
<li>Syncto: Browsing Firefox Sync using the Kinto protocol.</li>
<li>Kinto: Building synchronization services with backup and sharing
capabilities in mind.</li>
<li>RemoteServiceWorker: Building a Firefox Service Worker that does
heavy calculation in the cloud, to save battery life on mobile.</li>
<li>WebPush channels: Building a PubSub on top of WebPush</li>
</ul>
<p>While most of these projects have been built, deployed to production
and eventually decommissioned, some of them are still actively used by
Firefox users everyday.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-do-you-keep-motivated-building-things-that-are-thrown-away">
<h2>How do you keep motivated building things that are thrown away?</h2>
<img alt="Mozilla Dino Wallpaper" class="align-center" src="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/images/dino.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>
<p>Let's be honest: everything we build — cars, houses, and even software —
is meant to be eventually thrown away. That's why recycling is so
important.</p>
<p>The question is why do we keep building them nevertheless.</p>
<p>Our daily job is to help Mozilla make the web a safe place for users
and prevent their privacy from being compromised.</p>
<p>One way of doing so is to build software that empowers people to use
the Internet while being in charge of their own data.</p>
<p>When users give their data to big companies, they know they are giving
them too much power. In the meantime these companies are offering a
service that solve people problems, and they get addicted to it and
come back for more.</p>
<p>We alone cannot compete with companies that are spending millions of
dollars building great products to capture users.</p>
<p>However, we can build software that, on the one hand, is useful for
the Mozilla mission and enable us to fix Mozilla issues quickly while
building Firefox and, on the other hand, empowers developers to build
great software where users choose where they want to store and control
their data.</p>
<p>What matters rather than building software is the vision that this
software carries.</p>
<p>If you don't have a vision, what are you building? Sure, writing lines
of code is cheap and fast. You can build a prototype in two weeks and
iterate until you are happy with the Minimum Viable Product.</p>
<p>Note that, it might not be so cheap anymore when you start adding
documentation and maintenance costs.</p>
<p>However, the product might be used, and might get some traction for
months or even years but it will be eventually forgotten in a git
repository somewhere forever.</p>
<p>Writing software to solve problems is not enough, to keep motivated on
the long term. You need a greater goal than just writing code.</p>
<p>Knowing that, how do you keep motivated building things that are
thrown away?</p>
<p>Different people or communities might have different guiding questions.</p>
<p>For us the question is: As well as solving the problem, what can we
learn while building this solution that can be useful for us and for
our community to help us go faster and build more robust software
later.</p>
<p>For Mozilla the question is: How do I improve Firefox
so that people want to use it as their main browser?</p>
<p>Both questions lead to goals that we set to ourselves. We are using
software development to reach them.</p>
<p>Mozilla is calling that the True North, we are calling it a vision,
some other people might call it a utopia.</p>
<p>In both cases that vision should set the route of our ambition and
point out a direction for everyone to sail to.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-you-set-course-for-a-vision">
<h2>How do you set course for a vision?</h2>
<img alt="Draken sailing to the North" class="align-center" src="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/images/draken.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>
<p>OKRs are a way to cut your vision in steps and to move your vision
forward.</p>
<p>To be able to define OKRs from your vision, you need to be able to find
the fastest way to get closer to your aim, however what we can learn
from sailing is that the fastest way is rarely the shortest.</p>
<p>At Mozilla, we have a vision that is written down in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a>.</p>
<p>Mitchell Baker does a great job making sure everyone at Mozilla stays
aligned with that vision.</p>
<p>However agreeing on the fastest way and turning the Mozilla vision
into OKRs is really challenging and even more when you have a thousand
people's opinion about it.</p>
<p>It's the board's job to <a class="reference external" href="https://air.mozilla.org/mozilla-all-hands-hawaii-2016-20161221/">set course every six months</a> (or even less)
on what we should be focusing on for the next six months.</p>
<p>When this happens, it often means changing our course and killing
projects or at least putting them on the side if teams are turning to
new priorities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-you-define-what-the-priorities-are">
<h2>How do you define what the priorities are?</h2>
<img alt="Mozilla Logo as a Sailing Map — From https://uk.pinterest.com/explore/firefox-logo/" class="align-center" src="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/images/true-north.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>
<p>At our level, we are driven by the use case. We have a vision of what
we want to build. That vision leads to ideas of feature that we are
adding to the backlog.</p>
<p>However we are not building anything until we have a proper use case
for it. As soon as we have a use case it is added to our quaterly
roadmap.</p>
<p>You end up not spending time on tasks you don't need and for each use
case you are getting closer to your goal even if it might not be the
way you'd taken initially.</p>
<p>You also don't have to support code that you don't use. We even remove
features that are not used any more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="our-secret-is-opensource">
<h2>Our secret is opensource</h2>
<img alt="Open Source as a way to share" class="align-center" src="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/images/open-source-software.png" style="width: 1024px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>
<p>More than writing lines of code, we are researching solutions to
complex problems at scale and turning those solutions into production
ready experiments.</p>
<p>The advantage we have at Mozilla, is that everything we do is
published as Free, Libre, Opensource Software, which means that, even
if, as Mozilla employees, we focus on something else, the work we've
done is still available for the community to care about it.</p>
<p>Thunderbird is an example of this. Mozilla stopped spending resources
on it in July 2012 but five years later Mozilla Thunderbird is still
actively used by a large number of users every day.</p>
<p>When building software we solve complex issues and all the solutions
we have put together are really useful for other people who might need
to solve similar problems.</p>
<p>For instance, Mozilla Persona lead the ground for <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Firefox_Accounts">Firefox Accounts</a>
and the <a class="reference external" href="https://portier.github.io/">Portier project</a>, the Firefox Hello <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/loop-server">loop server</a> shows a
good example of how to build a WebRTC signaling server and was reused
later by <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Connected_Devices/Projects/Project_Link">Project Link</a>. The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/remote-worker-server">Remote Service Worker project</a> also
shows how to use <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">Python asyncio</a> to handle a large pool of
<a class="reference external" href="https://websockets.readthedocs.io/">websockets</a> using <a class="reference external" href="https://redis.io/">redis</a> to route messages between them.</p>

<h2>Building software as a way to learn</h2>
<img alt="Conference Room for DjangoCon Europe 2016" class="align-center" src="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/images/conferences.jpg" style="width: 1347px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>
<p>As you can see, every effort is not pointless because we learn a great
deal from all these projects.</p>
<p>Whether it takes us a month or a year to build something, we are
learning. And if you want ot make the most value of this learning, it
is important to share it as well.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are at least one kind of people that you need to inform
about what you are doing and learning about as part of your job: your
colleagues.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You need to explain what you are trying to solve.</li>
<li>You need to find out how to solve the issue and agree on the
solutions you are putting together.</li>
<li>You need to take feedback to be able to choose the best solution
even before having written a single line of code.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a next article we will see how we make sharing the core of the
process of building software as a distributed team.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we can only encourage you to write about what you are
building, go to conferences and tell others about what you learned and
listen to them so that you don't have to go through the same pitfall.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, don't build software to build software, build it to
solve people's problems. Set a long term goal, work toward that goal and
iterate. Do not be afraid of killing things that don't work.</p>
<p>In the meantime, make the process of building software a way to learn
new things and share what you've learn. Then you don't have to worry
about your project being decommissioned because you've already got the
take aways of building it.</p>
<p>Make the process of building software a way to share what you've
learned.</p>
